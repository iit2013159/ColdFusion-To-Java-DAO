# ColdFusion-To-Java-DAO
This project objective is to convert coldfusion code i.e. .cfc file to java . Many of the Adobe flex project uses colfusion as DAO layer. Our code will be able to convert all those files to a proper java class where each function will be able to return ResultSet or Count based on the nature of the query.
